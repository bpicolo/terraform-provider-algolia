UNMAINTAINED:

This project became unmaintained because I left the role that required Algolia usage, and some sort of subsequent changes to Algolia's API made operations invalid (they can now somehow actually corrupt a search index =/).

This may be a useful base point to starting point for others, though, so I'll leave it around.

# terraform-provider-algolia
This is an in-progress terraform provider for various Algolia resources.

- [X] Indices (In progress)
- [ ] Api Keys
- [ ] Query Rules?
- [ ] Vault
